# node-red-contrib-rpi-ble
Node-red nodes implementation for Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals. It's based on ```node-ble``` package. It was the only package where notifications works on raspberry (at least for me).

For now, take a look at the example flow. Detailed documentation will be provide later.
